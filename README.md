# TV-For-Me

Upon an initial visit to TV For Me the user is greeted with a collection of shows and artists presented through two carousels. The user can then navigate to a genre of their choosing or use the search bar to find something specific. Users can then add/remove shows to their watchlist which is updated through the use of localStorage.

This project was built using HTML, CSS, React JS, React Router, React Multi Carousel, and Uniqid. All data was pulled from the TV Maze API.
